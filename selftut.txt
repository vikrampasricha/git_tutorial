A-steps to save local code to github
git - status -this commands helps to identify which files have changes or are created new and need to be commited
git add . -this commands add all files that are created new or there are changes
git commit -m "msg for this particular comit"-this command is to commit all the changes in add
git push main -it is to push all the changes to the respository in remote github respository
git init -to create new respository



B-steps if we have created new respository local and to push it to github
1-go to that respository
2(git init)-this instialises the respository
3(git add .)-add all changes
4(git commit -m "msg")-commit all the changes
5-create respository in github 
6- copy shh url
7(git remote add origin url)-this adds the link of respository where the local respository is to be pushed
8(git push origin main)-this push code to the remote repo


C-steps if we want to fix the default repo we wish to push code(upstream)
git push -u origin main


to create a pr of changes made in new branch
git push - u origin branch_name
review changes and write what is changed



to bring changes made in main branch to local pc 
git pull origin branch_name


to undo the changes in git
git reset file_name or.
git reset HEAD~1-if we have added and commited the file,it will take back 2 steps back ,this statemnt means we want to go back +1 steps back from current back


if we want to go particular commit from git log but the changes will not go
git reset log_id

if we want the changes to go and remove lines after that commit
git reset --hard log_id
